# DDRINQ: Data Driven Investments - Not Quantum

The investment strategy is grounded in data, incorporating techniques derived from previous experiences.
It steers clear of the repetitive, redundant, irrelevant, exhaustive, and costly procedures
linked to quantum computing when constructing these models.

The platform displays executed trades, a refined list of trades under consideration,
or those earmarked for monitoring on the upcoming trading day pending the fulfillment of specified conditions.
On posting a trade request, it becomes visible to others.
This site provides an early preview of potential trade requests, offering more advanced notice.
The pertinent outcomes of technical analysis conducted are made available and accessible to users accessing this site.

The strategy involves scrutinizing over 1000 securities to discern trends.
Signals are generated at the close of each trading day, becoming effective the subsequent trading day.
Any security that satisfies a predefined set of criteria are selected.
These chosen securities are distinguished by their volatility and high liquidity,
typically involving a daily trading volume of at least one million shares.
Daily evaluations pinpoint potential securities for buy and sell actions based on predefined thresholds.

Simple mathematical models, complemented by a few more complex conditions, are employed to detect upward and downward trends.
It's important to note that while no guarantees are made, historical charts dating back to 2010 (or the security's addition date)
illustrate the effectiveness of the analysis over the past decade across all chosen securities.

The results indicate success over the long term for each individual security, even though specific trades may not always be profitable on their own.
To mitigate risks, diversification is strongly recommended both in terms of the number of securities held and the number of trades made.
This strategy helps neutralize the impact of sudden market spikes in either direction.

All trades, executed or considered to be executed, are transparently displayed on the site.
The Ticker page offers detailed comparisons, showcasing the performance of holding a security for a year,
trading based on conditions, and maintaining a diversified portfolio.
The Analysis page provides specific comparisons for each security,
while the Buy and Sell pages outline potential conditions for the next trading day.

The annualized daily buy/sell return, along with the Delta from the execution price, is presented to offer comprehensive information.
Columns can be sorted by clicking, and filters can be applied to most fields.

The Last Transaction page reveals when the last conditions were met for each security,
providing insights into recent and infrequent occurrences.
The Ticker page serves as the main hub, displaying annual returns, a complete trade history since 2010,
and price trends over the past 250 and 500 days.

The Brief page offers a condensed view of this information.
The ticker list box and accompanying option buttons allow users to filter by All, Buy, Sell, Held, and Wait categories.
Refresh times are conveniently displayed on the menu, occurring a few hours after the prior day's market close.
